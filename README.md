# meet-starter

First register and make an account.
Then, click on the (+) to add a new event.
In the URL box, you can add the meeting url. The URL should look something like this: 

https://fuhsd-org.zoom.us/j/9161756777?pwd=MGdrMGZrS3BJb3g0cmV2ZGZpY3NGUT09

make sure to set the launch time to about 1-2 minutes before the scheduled time to make sure you won't be late.
Events will start automatically at the given time, so you can just leave the app on in the background, and do whatever you need to do.
If there is a different schedule, you can instead press the join button to take you to the meeting directly.


At the far left there is also a to-do list where you can add tasks to organize your work. You can type in a task, and then click on it once it is finished.
